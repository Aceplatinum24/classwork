## 2
## Try this.
# import random

## 3b
## Copy and modify the above example so that 
## if the name is "dell", it will print "Thatâ€™s a computer brand."


## 3c
## Try this.
## Notice that the "Have a good day" line prints regardless of

## 7
## Modify the above example so that if the name is

## 7b
## You'll notice that in the "joe" example, the user must

## 7bb
## Copy and modify the previous example so that

## Make it work for any capitalization of Ruby.

## 7c
## Try this. What do you think the != operator means?
# name = input("What is your name? ")
# if name.lower() != "jay": 
#     print("Your name is not Jay.")

## 7d
## - Ask the user for a name
## - If the name is anything other than Bob, then
##   display "I don't think I know you. I only know Bob."
## Hint: the != operator means "not equal".


## 7dd
## - Ask the user for a number
## - If the number is not equal to 5, say "You should have picked 5." 
## (Use the != operator)
    

## 7e
## - Ask the user for a name
## - If the name is empty, say "You didn't type anything!"
## - Otherwise, say "Hi ___."
## Hint: an empty name would be quotes with nothing inside, so
##     you might use something similar to this piece of code:
##     if whatTheUserTyped == "":
##           print("Something would go here.")


## 8 
## Try this. 
# age = 10 
# ageNextYear = age + 1

## 10 
## Try this. 
# age = int(input("How old are you?")) 
# ageNextYear = age + 1 
# print(ageNextYear) 


## 11
## Write a program that satisfies the following examples. Remember that the "âœŽ" indicates user input.
## Example 1:
##   How old are you? âœŽ 55
##   I see you are 55 years old.
##   You will be 65 years old in 10 years.
## Example 2:
##   How old are you? âœŽ 45
##   I see you are 45 years old.
##   You will be 65 years old in 20 years.

# age = int(input("How old are you?")) 
# agein20yrs = age + 20 
# print(f"You will be {agein20yrs} years old in 20 years.") 

## 12
## Try this. Note: you will get an error. 
# age = int(input("How old are you?"))
# if age < 21: 
#     print("You can't drink alcohol in the US yet.") 
# else: 
#     print("You are legally allowed to drink. Drink responsibly ðŸ˜Š ") 
     
## 13
## Modify the above example so it works.
## Youâ€™ll use the `int` function. 

## 14
## Copy and modify the above example so that
## it shows how many years remain until you can
## drink (but only display that if youâ€™re
## under the drinking age). 

## 15
## Write a program that takes a name from the user.
## If the name is the letter "A", say
## "Your name is just the letter A? Thatâ€™s kinda cool".
## Otherwise, say "Ok, your name is ___".

## 16c
## Try this. How is it different from the previous example?
## (The difference is subtle, so ask if you are unsure.)
# name = input("What is your name? (type it lowercase please.)")

#     print("Does the origin of your name relate to lace?")
# else:
#     print("I don't know you.")
# print("Done.")

## 17
## Here's an example of using separate if statements,
## that is, a case where you would NOT want to use elif:
# name = input("What is your name? (type it lowercase please.)")
# print("Ok, let me look up that name...")
# if name.startswith("z"):

# if len(name) > 9:
#     print("Your name is more than 9 characters long.")
# if name == "":
#     print("Your name is empty!")

## 17b
## Here's another example of the usefulness of elif.
# heightInInches = int(input("Give me a number: "))
# if heightInInches < 0:
#     print("You can't have a negative height!")
# elif heightInInches <= 55:
#     print("That's relatively short.")
# elif heightInInches <= 72:
#     print("That's around average.")
# else:
#     print("That's pretty tall.")

## 17c
## Copy and modify the previous example so that each `elif` is
## simply `if`. How does it act differently? 
 
## 18
## Ask the user how many French fries they want.
## Display different responses depending on how many they
## request. (Examples: "Thatâ€™s way too many!", etc.) 

## 19
## Try this. Did it print what you expected?
# x = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
# if x < 20: 
#     print("A") 
#     print("B") 
# print("C") 

## 20
## Copy and modify the previous example so
## that C is only printed if the number is not less than 20.
## Use the `else` keyword.

## 20b
## Copy and modify the previous example so that it acts like this:
## if x is less than 20, then print A.
## Otherwise, print C.
## After all of that is done, print Goodbye
## (regardless of what x was.)

## 20c
## Try this.
# x = int(input("Type a number: "))
# if x > 3 and x < 10:
#     print("x is more than 3 and less than 10.")

## 20d
## Here's a shorter way to write the same example:
# x = int(input("Type a number: "))
# if 3 < x < 10:
#     print("x is more than 3 and less than 10.")
    
## 21
## Ask the user for a number.
## If the user gives a number more than 50, 
##    then ask "What is your name?"
##    and display "Hello" followed by the name.
## If the user gives any other number,
##    then ask "How did you pick that number?"
##    and regardless of what they say, display "I see."
## After all of that, say "Have a good day."

## 22
## Write a program that takes a number from the user.
## Display the number doubled.
## Then do a sequence of creative if statements of your choice.
##   For example, if the number is negative,
##   display "Really? Negative? Interesting".

## 22b
## Try this. Why do we use float instead of int here?
# firstcost = float(input("How much is the first thing you bought? "))
# secondcost = float(input("How much is the second thing you bought? "))
# total = firstcost + secondcost
# discounted = total * 0.9
# print(f"""The total cost would be {total}.
# However, we're doing a special sale today, so you get a 10% discount.
# That means you actually pay {discounted}""")

## 23
## Try this.
# x = float(input("Type a non-whole number. "))
# print(f"One more would be {x + 1}.")
## As you can see, you can use `float` instead of
##  `int` when dealing with non-whole numbers.
## Sidenote: 
##   (this sidenote is outside the scope of the class, but good to know)
##   Using floats can cause weird rounding errors. For example:
# print(1.03 - 0.42)
##   This will print 0.6100000000000001.
##   That's quite important when doing comparisons:
# if 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3:
#     print("This will not print.")
# else:
#     print("This will print... what is math??")
##   The reason is because the numbers are converted to
##   binary behind the scenes,
##   and just as you can't express "one third" exactly in decimal
##   (0.33333 is not EXACTLY one third)
##   you can't express "one tenth" exactly in binary.
##   For more info, see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html
##   If you plan to eventually do any "real-life" programming,
##   then it's definitely worth reading.
## (end of sidenote)

## 23b
## Ask the user for the cost of a single item
## and the quantity purchased. Print the total cost. 
## Make sure this works for non-integer costs.
## For example, try a cost of 2.30 and quantity of 2.
## Hint: You'll use float instead of int.
## Example:
##   What is the cost for an item? âœŽ 2.30
##   How many did you buy? âœŽ 2
##   The total cost would be $4.60.

## 24
## Modify the previous example so that the shop gives
## a discount of 10% if you buy at least 20 of an item.  
## For example, if one item costs $5, and youâ€™re buying 20,
## the total cost would be $90. 
     
## 25
## Ask the user for a number
## (make sure to allow for non-whole numbers).
## Print the absolute value of the
## number without using the abs function. 

## 26
## Ask the user for a temperature in Celsius,
## and display the temperature in Fahrenheit. 
## Make sure to allow for non-whole numbers.

## 27
## Same as previous example, but backwards. 

## 28
## Combine the two previous examples: ask the user for
## a number and which way to convert. 

## 29
## Ask the user for a number.
## Using the % operator, display "The remainder of
## your number divided by 5 is ___."
## Also, if the remainder that you calculated is 0,
## display "That number is evenly divisible by 5."

## 30
## Try this.
# color = input("What color is water? ")
# if color == "blue" or color == "transparent":
#     print("Yes, I agree.")
# else:
#     print("I'm not sure about that.")

## 31
## Try this.
# color = input("What color is water? ")
# if color in ["blue", "transparent"]:
#     print("Yes, I agree.")
# else:
#     print("I'm not sure about that.")

## 32
## Try this.
# color = input("What color is water? ")
# if color != "blue" and color != "transparent":
#     print("I'm not sure about that.")
# else:
#     print("Yes, I agree.")

## 33
## Try this.
# color = input("What color is water? ")
# if color not in ["blue", "transparent"]:
#     print("I'm not sure about that.")
# else:
#     print("Yes, I agree.")

## 34
## Ask the user what sound a dog makes.
## If the user says any of "woof", "bark", or "ruff",
## then display "That's correct!"
## otherwise, display "Not quite."
## Make it work for any capitalization.
