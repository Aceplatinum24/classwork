## 1
## Try this example

# x = 13 / 5
# print(x, "is the result of 13 / 5 using regular division.")

# y = 13 // 5
# print(y, "is the result of 13 // 5 sometimes called floor division.")

# z = 13 % 5
# print(z, "is the result of 13 % 5 sometimes called modulus or the remainder.")

# print(f"So 13 divided by 5 gives you {x};")
# print(f"Using floor division (13 // 5) drops the remainder giving you {y}.")
# print(f"The modulus operator (%) gives you only the remainder of")
# print(f"the operation ({z}).")
# print(f"This represents 3 fifths or 3/5, which equals {z/5}")

# a = 2 ** 5
# print(a, "is the result of 2 ** 5, or 2 to the 5th power.")
# print("5 is the exponent, so this can be called exponentiation.")
# print("The (**) operator gives 2 to the power of 5 or 2*2*2*2*2")

## Now let's incorporate some inputs.
## Ask the user for two numbers.
## Display "If you divided ___ by ___, then you
## would get ____ with a remainder of ___".


## 2a
## Here's a real life example:
# pieces_of_candy = 23
# people = 5

# candy_per_person = pieces_of_candy // people
# leftover = pieces_of_candy % people
# print(f"If you had {pieces_of_candy} pieces of candy,")
# print(f"and you wanted to share it with {people} people,")
# print(f"each person would get {candy_per_person} pieces,")
# print(f"and there would be {leftover} leftover.")

## Calculating an exponent
## Ask the user for two numbers.
## Display "If you computed ___ to the power of ___, then you would get ___."
## (Hint: What is the operator for exponent in Python?
##  It may not be what you think.)

## Operators that may not do what you expect
## Based on question #1, does % calculate a percentage? (Answer: No)
## Based on question #2, does ^ calculate an exponent? (Answer: No)
